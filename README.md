Phylogenetic trees: Background\n
  Data:   Multiple datasets of species and their genetic info\n
  general goal:   Build Maximum likelihood Phylogenetic trees\n
          Highly computational intensive
          \n

Project goal:   Accelerate the search Using Machine Learning tools / Using Reinforcement learning methodology
