Phylogenetic trees: Background
  Data:   Multiple datasets of species and their genetic info
  general goal:   Build Maximum likelihood Phylogenetic trees
          Highly computational intensive
          

Project goal:   Accelerate the search Using Machine Learning tools / Using Reinforcement learning methodology
